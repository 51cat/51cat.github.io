## 标准化数据

```
RPKM = numReads / ( geneLength/1000 * totalNumReads/1,000,000 )
```

​      numReads        - number of reads mapped to a gene sequence

​      geneLength      - length of the gene sequence

​      totalNumReads   - total number of mapped reads of a sample

```
CPM = (readsMappedToGene/totalNumReads) / 10^6
```

​     totalNumReads       - total number of mapped reads of a sample

​     readsMappedToGene   - number of reads mapped to a selected gene

## quality value

**Phred   Error-rate    Accuracy**

 **10**     1 of 10        90%       # very low quality

 **20**     1 of 100       99%       # minimum quality for many tools

 **30**     1 of 1000      99.9%     # reasonable good quality

 **40**     1 of 10000     99.99%    # high quality

 **50**     1 of 100000    99.999%   # very high quality

## 换算

**1 kbp** (kilo base pairs) = 1,000 bp (base pairs)

**1 Mbp** (mega base pairs) = 1,000,000 bp

**1 Gbp** (giga base pairs) = 1,000,000,000 bp
